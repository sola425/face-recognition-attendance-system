# Enrollment Instructions

To make the system recognize you, you need to add your photos here.

**Strategy:**
For each person, take 3-5 photos with different angles:
1.  `Name_Front.jpg` (Straight on)
2.  `Name_Side.jpg` (Slightly turned)
3.  `Name_Down.jpg` (Looking down/reading)

**Example:**
- `Elon_Musk_Front.jpg`
- `Elon_Musk_Side.jpg`

The code will automatically learn these faces when you run it.
